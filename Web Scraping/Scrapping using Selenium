There are two python files.
The app_bot.py file contains the code for web scrapping the first page of indeed.com that comes when you give the respective inputs
to it using the tkinter.
The inputs are taken using the tkinter python file.
The scrapped data is stored in a file named datascience.csv(you can change the name as you want)
