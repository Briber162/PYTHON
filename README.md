Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro. Each season she maintains a record of her play.
She tabulates the number of times she breaks her season record for most points and least points in a game.
Points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.
Given Maria's scores for a season, find and print the number of times she breaks her records for most and least points scored during the season.

The problem statement for file birds.py is:

You have been asked to help study the population of birds migrating across the continent. Each type of bird you are interested
in will be identified by an integer value. Each time a particular kind of bird is spotted, 
its id number will be added to your array of sightings. You would like to be able to find out which type of bird
is most common given a list of sightings. Your task is to print the type number of that bird and if two or more
types of birds are equally common, choose the type with the smallest ID number.
